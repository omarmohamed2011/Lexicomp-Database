Isatuximab (Lexi-Drugs),"Interference with serological testing (indirect antiglobulin test): Isatuximab binds to CD38 on RBCs, which may result in a false-positive indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test), antibody detection (screening) tests, antibody identification panels, and antihuman globulin crossmatches in patients treated with isatuximab. Conduct blood type and screening prior to the first isatuximab infusion; consider phenotyping prior to initiating treatment. If isatuximab treatment has already been initiated, inform the blood bank that the patient is receiving isatuximab and isatuximab interference with blood compatibility testing can be resolved using dithiothreitol-treated RBCs. If an emergency transfusion is required, non–cross-matched ABO/RhD-compatible RBCs can be given per local blood bank practices.

Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation tests: Isatuximab is an IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that may be incidentally detected by serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation assays used for endogenous M-protein monitoring and may interfere with the accuracy of determining complete response in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.

Keep grapefruit/grapefruit juice consumption consistent; monitor for altered effects with concomitant use.

Capsule (65 mg [Tolsura]): Absorption increased when administered on an empty stomach; however, administration of Tolsura (2 x 65 mg capsule) with food results in exposure similar to those achieved when Sporanox (2 x 100 mg capsule) is administered with food.

Some quinolones may produce a false-positive urine screening result for opioids using commercially-available immunoassay kits.
